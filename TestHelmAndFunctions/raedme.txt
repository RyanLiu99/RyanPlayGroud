Use this repo to test helm functions etc,  no intent to install any release


Helm debug commands


helm template ReleaserName Chart directory like . for current chart directory [flags]    //static, for each template, it will generate a yaml file for you to preview
helm install [release] [chart] --debug --dry-run  //dynamic

Other commands does require install a chart as release:

To see the currently applied value overrides (compared to the chart values)
helm get values <release_name> //Ryan list user supplied values in yaml format
helm get values <release_name> -oyaml >xxx_values.yam

To see all values (original chart values with overrides applied) that were used when creating the actual resources for an installed release
helm get values <release_name> --all

To see all the resources generated for an installed release
helm get manifest <release_name>
 
helm list  //list releases
