 kubectl logs webapinet5pod webapinet5-1

 kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

 t is recommended that users create Pods only through a Controller, and not directly. 
 See Controllers: Deployment, Job, or StatefulSet.

 Now run 2 instances in one pod on different ports. 3 containers and reslilient .
 1 container for pod. 2 for 2 instances of app.
 If you kill one app container, it will create again, even no k8s deployment involved.

 If you kill pod container, it will also kill 2 app containers. But it will then create all 3 again.
